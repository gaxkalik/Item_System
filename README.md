Item System                        


Compiling and Running the program:
You must have JRE installation on your machine.
From the src folder run terminal and type "Main.java".
Or open any IDE that supports java and run the Main class

Available commands:
add - adding item to inventory
show - shows the inventory (after showing you must press enter)
upgrade - upgrades the selected item
exit - terminates the program


Inputs should be same way as written on screen. 


In Inventory class I haven't implemented separate methods for grouping due to time limit at lines
43-53 implemented grouping by rarity and the lines from 61 to 78 is grouping by upgrade counter.





Program should run like this :
